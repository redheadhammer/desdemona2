# Support the Project

There are a few things you can do to support the project:

- Star the repository (and follow me on GitHub for more)
- Share and upvote on sites like Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News
- Report any bugs, glitches, or errors that you find

These things motivate me to to keep sharing what I build, and they provide
validation that my work is appreciated! They also help me improve the
project. Thanks in advance!

If you are insistent on spending money to show your support, I encourage you to
instead make a generous donation to one of the following organizations. By advocating
for Internet freedoms, organizations like these help me to feel comfortable
releasing work publicly on the Web.

- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/)
- [Signal Foundation](https://signal.org/donate/)
- [Mozilla](https://donate.mozilla.org/en-US/)
